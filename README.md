# Spotify Stats Hooks Demo

This is Spotify-themed application to demonstrate hooks in React. Heavily inspired by [Stats for Spotify](https://www.statsforspotify.com/).

Run locally with "npm start". It should be located at https://localhost:3000.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
